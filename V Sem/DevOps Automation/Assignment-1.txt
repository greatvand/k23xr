1. Ask ShellGPT to create a bash script that displays system uptime, current user, and disk usage. Run it and screenshot the output.

2. Ask ShellGPT to explain what `chmod +x` does and then use it on your script.

3. Ask ShellGPT to generate a one-liner bash command to list the 5 most recently modified files in `/home/<your_username>`.

4. Use ShellGPT to generate a script that takes a directory path as argument, counts how many `.txt`, `.py`, and `.sh` files are inside, and displays the count in a formatted table. Run and show the output for two different directories.

5. Ask ShellGPT to debug your script after intentionally adding an error (for example, a typo in a variable name). Show before and after corrections.

6. Ask ShellGPT to optimize your script for efficiency and shorter syntax.

7. Use ShellGPT to write a menu-based utility using a `case` statement that offers:
   1 → Show current date/time
   2 → Show top 5 processes by CPU usage
   3 → Show total number of running services
   4 → Exit
   Run it once and capture the output.

8. Ask ShellGPT to convert that bash menu into a Python script that performs the same functions.

9. Ask ShellGPT to generate a funny Linux fortune message generator script using `echo` and `shuf`. Customize it to print your name.

10. Ask ShellGPT to combine all your scripts into a single “toolkit.sh” file with a simple text-based interface to access each mini-utility.
